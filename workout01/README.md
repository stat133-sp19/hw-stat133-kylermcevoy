# Stat 133 Workout 1

**Author**: Kyle McEvoy, student in Stat 133, Spring 2019 semester

**Date**: 03/09/2019

**Project**: To prepare NBA shot chart data from the 2016-2017 NBA season for 5  
Golden State Warriors players, to analyze that data and create a narrative and  
visual report about what the data tells us.  
The players we are analyzing are Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, Klay Thompson,  
and Draymond Green. 

**Purpose**: The purpose is two-fold.  The main purpose is to use this project as an opportunity  
to learn more about data analysis and reporting using programming.  The secondary purpose, is to  
complete the project as specified, exploring the research question on Shot Chart data  
creating a report that tells us something about where and how five Warriors players make shots.  
As these five players are the five key players for the Golden State Warriors,  
analyzing their shot charts can give us insight into the success of the team.  
Since the Warriors won the NBA Championship in the 2016-2017 season, we can potentially  
glean translatable insights into how other teams might succeed in the NBA.

**File Structure**: All directories contained in the workout01 parent directory,  
R scripts located in code directory, Data located in .csv files in data directory,
Report files including .rmd files in the report directory.  
Output and images files will be located in those respective directories.

**IMPORTANT**: All file paths in code scripts are specified relative to the working directory being set to the workout01 parent directory.
All file paths in report .rmd file are set to use workout01/report as the working directory.

Please use setwd() function to set the working directory to workout01 before running any code in this project.
