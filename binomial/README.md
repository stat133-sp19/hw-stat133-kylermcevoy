# Stat 133 Workout 3

**Author**: Kyle McEvoy, student in Stat 133, Spring 2019 semester

**Date**: 05/01/2019

**Project**: To build an R package centered on functions and methods involving the Binomial distribution. 
Including summary measures, functions to compute probabilities and create data.frames, also includes plotting methods for data.frames and printing methods for summary statistics.

**Purpose**: The purpose of this project is to learn more about R through programming an R package, experimenting with creating a testthat regime and various devtools functions to build a working R package.
 The secondary purpose is to create a useful working package that provides functions that help users study, model and analyze the binomial distribution and probability experiments that follow Binomial distributions.

**File Structure**: All directories contained in the binomial parent directory,  
R scripts located in R sub-directory, tests located in tests directory, introductory vignettes in the vignettes directory.
Check DESCRIPTION file and NAMESPACE file to read more about the package license, author, maintainer and suggested packages, and all of the exported function names and methods.

**IMPORTANT**: All file paths in code scripts are specified relative to the working directory being the binomial parent directory.

Please use setwd() function to set the working directory to binomial parent directory before running any code in this project.
